# Lecture Slide Extractor script

## Overview
This script was created as a personal project to extract lecture slides from a PDF and convert them into a single PNG image. I use the image with the app Miro for whiteboard-style learning where I can leave notes on each lecture slide to refer back to.

## Compilation and Execution

**I converted the script into .exe to run it easily.**

**The interface has:**
- **Width & Height**: Each lecturer has a different style for creating slides so creating a dynamic width and height allows me to avoid lecture slides being stretched.
- **Rows**: Lecture slides vary in size a lot so having the ability to create more rows for larger PDFs saves space and improves readability.
- **Select PDF**: Once the width, height, and rows have been selected the select PDF button will open to the downloads folder on your pc.
- **Saving the PNG**: Saving a PNG is set to my personal computer UNI folder which will need to be changed in the code if you download my code.
